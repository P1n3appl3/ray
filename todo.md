- rng performance, consider passing one arround and using xor/small
- triangles
- carry references to materials/textures instead of owning
- separate material from entity and store tuples of them in bvh
- interactive view (update as tracing, pause or save on demand)
- generalize rotations to not just be around the y axis, maybe 4d transform matrix
- AOS -> SOA
- simd bvh aabb checking (vec3 is bad but try anyway)
- wasm
- lens flare (http://resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/lensflareRendering/)
