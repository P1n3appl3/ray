- environment mapping (probe images linked from book site)
- rng performance, consider passing one arround
- triangles
- build the bvh without copying stuff all over the place
- carry references to materials/textures instead of owning
- separate material from entity and store tuples of them in bvh
- interactive view (update as tracing, pause or save on demand)
- generalize rotations to not just be around the y axis
